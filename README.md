### Hello! 

My name is Bryana A.S. Thieret and I am a doctoral student in the department of Applied Behavior Sciences at the University of Kansas. I graduated from St. Lawrence University with a B.S. in Psychology and Statistics in 2024. Most research I have done consists of animal model research looking at impulsive choice and action behavior.
